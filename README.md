# Altman-Z-Score-and-Bankruptcy-Prediction
Using Altman Z to predict whether a bank will default or not?
The Altman Z is constructed following the standard formula: 

Altman Z-Score = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E

Where:

A = working capital / total assets
B = retained earnings / total assets
C = earnings before interest and tax / total assets
D = market value of equity / total liabilities
E = sales / total assets

However within the code there are modifications in terms of variables which are clearly defined in calculations.

The data I have used within the code is Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction Data which is freely available in UCI 
machine learning repository.
